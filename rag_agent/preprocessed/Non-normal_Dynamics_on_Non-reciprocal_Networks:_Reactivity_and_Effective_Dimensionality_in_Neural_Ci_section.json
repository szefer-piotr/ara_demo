In this work, we investigate how these two forms of\nnon-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At the local level, each population\nis modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations ex-\nhibiting transient amplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are coupled\nvia directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural non-normality. Since non-reciprocal\ninteractions generically lead to non-normal linear operators, we frame both local and global asymme-\ntries in terms of non-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson\u2013Cowan framework, we analyze how\nthe interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system\u2019s behavior. We show that\ntheir combination leads to emergent collective dynamics, including fluctuation-driven transitions,\ndimensionality reduction, and novel nonequilibrium steady states.
