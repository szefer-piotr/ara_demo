    "content": "The digitalization of societies raises questions about its sustainabil-\nity and the socio-technical impacts it generates. Ecological redi-\nrection applied to organizations is a field of research aiming for\nachieving sustainability as a direction, rather than for technical\nmeans. Arbitration and renunciation to some digital usage and tech-\nnologies are investigated. Ecological redirection is, however, not\nyet addressing concrete methodologies for its implementation in\norganizations. This paper therefore proposes a protocol to support\nstakeholders in the ecological redirection of their digital practices.\nThis protocol is based on mapping attachments to digital tools\nthrough a multi-disciplinary survey. It then proposes increasing\nstakeholders\u2019 knowledge and skills to prepare a debate on the ar-\nbitration of renunciations, and finally, to operationalize the clo-\nsure/transformation of targeted digital practices. This protocol will\nbe tested in real conditions in different contexts. An empirical study\nis proposed to measure 1) the fluidity with which participants carry\nout the protocol, 2) the effectiveness of the protocol in terms of\nthe redirection objective, 3) the socio-technical barriers to the redi-\nrection process. The paper concludes on the potential benefits for\norganizations to better understand both the barriers related to its\necological redirection and the transformative aim of such protocols.\nThis will help them trigger large and radical policies towards a\ndesirable and sustainable society."

Of course, not\nall activities should be closed, and stakeholders should be able to\nsuggest certain arbitrations in the process of renunciation, based\non criteria of (un)sustainability and vulnerability.\nThe field of ecological redirection is particularly developed in\nFrance5. Its approach is currently mainly theoretical and requires\nfurther specification, especially within the context of the digital\nsector: \u2018[...] This situation, experienced by generations endogenous\nto the digital age, dramatizes the questions we can ask about the\nconditions for achieving sobriety, or even implementing active\nprocesses of detachment or renunciation. This question seems to\nus to open a considerable and urgently needed area of research\u2019\n[5]. Organizations, however concerned about the environmental\nimpact of their digital tools, usually find it difficult to make a real\necological redirection due to a lack of efficient methodology.\nThis article thus proposes a protocol for the ecological redirec-\ntion of digital tools and practices for organizations. It can be applied\nto any organization, whatever its size and scope, strategy, gover-\nnance structure, incorporation structure or relationship to profit\n(these five dimensions of business have been theorized by Jennifer\nHinton [21]). The protocol can be applied, for example, by publicly-\ntraded shareholder corporations, producer cooperatives, worker\ncooperatives, dual purpose companies or not-for-profit structures.\nSection 2 presents the framework of ecological redirection. Sec-\ntion 3 is a proposition for a protocol for the ecological redirection of\ndigital tools and practices for organizations. Section 4 explores the\napplication of this protocol to case studies, and outlines objectives\nfor evaluating and improving the protocol. Section 5 concludes on\na perspective regarding the challenges related to the ecological\nredirection of the digital sector."

The protocol leader reminds participants\nthe session\u2019s objectives.\nThe first part of the action plan involves defining the motivations\nof the focus group for creating this action plan (\"We believe it is\nimportant to implement this action plan because...\"). Participants\nthen name a follow-up reference person to ensure the proper imple-\nmentation of redirection actions and the continuity of the protocol\nin the future, as well as a communication reference for communicat-\ning the plan within the organization. This accountability anchors\nthe ecological redirection approach as a sustainable practice within\nthe organization.\nNext, participants agree on a few key functions (ideally a small\nnumber to comply with the time constraints and to establish an\nachievable plan of action) currently handled by digital tools (as\nidentified by the researcher), which they will debate. These could\ninclude internal communication, finances, human resource manage-\nment, administration, creative activities, external communication,\netc. For each function, participants suggest different digital sobriety\nmeasures. These measures should be understood in a broad sense,\nas they can take multiple forms: a political positioning of the orga-\nnization, the replacement of a digital tool, the de-digitization of a\npractice, the introduction of a new business strategy, the discontin-\nuation of a service, the restructuring of the organization, and so on.\nThe range of possibilities is wide, and the potential impacts on the\norganization may vary in scale. A classification for these different\ncategories of action is proposed in Figure 2. Participant might use\nthis supporting figure to expose their propositions by answer the\nquestion : \"What we want to (as an organisation) ?\"\nFigure 2: Categorization of actions for digital ecological redi-\nrection\nThe digital sobriety actions proposed by the focus group should\nbe based on the material of the previous workshops. For each func-\ntion explored, the group should:\n(1) Review the digital tools currently in use;\n(2) Identify the organization\u2019s attachments to these tools;\n(3) Understand the environmental issues associated with these\ntools;\n(4) List potential alternatives to certain tools, if needed, in accor-\ndance with the vision of a desirable digital future developed\nduring the imagination workshop;\n(5) Engage in debate to reach a consensual proposal.\nHere are some clarifications regarding the structure of this de-\nliberation process:\n\u2022 The facilitator plays a key role in guiding the focus group\ntoward relevant propositions by supporting an informed and\nstructured deliberation process.\n\u2022 Digital tools with the greatest environmental impact should\nbe prioritized when proposing sobriety measures. The level\nof ambition of these measures should be in accordance with\nthe associated environmental impact.\n\u2022 Attachments to digital tools must be taken into account when\nformulating proposals, using both quantitative and qualita-\ntive analysis. The stronger the attachment to a tool, the more\ncarefully the proposed measures should be implemented so\nas not to disrupt the subsistence networks of those who rely\non it, to ensure the availability of satisfactory alternatives12,\nand to respect social justice. If we get back to our fictional\nexample of a primary school, an application designed to sup-\nport students with dyslexia may have a low environmental\nimpact and be strongly valued by the students who use it. In\nsuch a case, renouncing the this tool would not be acceptable,\nas it would negatively affect those students. Instead, efforts\nshould focus on tools with greater environmental impact.\n\u2022 The objective of these discussions is to reach consensus\nwithin the focus group for each proposal. If consensus cannot\nbe achieved, a vote may be used to resolve non-consensual\ndecisions.\nFinally, the protocol leader offers participants, especially the\nfollow-up reference person, resources to maintain a redirectionist\nposture (questioning the need and compatibility of practices with\nplanetary boundaries) within the organization.\n3.5"

The renunciation of digital tools is\nhindered by socio-technical barriers of various kinds and at differ-\nent scales.

However, these\nmechanisms do not adequately explain collective dependencies\non digital technologies, as collective dependency does not simply\nequate to the sum of individual dependencies [4]. Therefore, a qual-\nitative inquiry will be conducted following the implementation of\nthe case studies to properly objectify these socio-technical barriers\nat the collective level.

This theoretical frame-\nwork remains highly conceptual and requires operationalization\nfor organizations. This paper proposes a protocol for the ecological\nredirection of digital tools and practices within organizations, based\non four phases: mapping of attachments, workshops, debate on ar-\nbitrations, and implementation of closures. This protocol aims to\nsupport organizations in taking radical and concrete action toward\ndigital de-escalation. It offers a grip for individuals who feel pow-\nerless regarding the digitization of society and the rising impacts\nrelated to it.\nA Protocol to Address Ecological Redirection for Digital Practices in Organizations"

    "content": "While this explicit protocol facilitates the implementation of\necological redirection in organizational activities, it is important to\nunderstand that this practice is strongly dependent on the political\ncontext in which organizations operate. The issue of renunciation\nand closure of certain industrial activities are currently difficult to\neven consider for most actors, particularly industrial ones, because\nof the neoliberal capitalist political framework in which they are. It\nis crucial to emphasize that the protocol for the ecological redirec-\ntion of digital practices proposed in this article will be difficult to\ngeneralize within a techno-industrial society not engage in strong\nenvironmental policies and still settled in a regime of economic\ngrowth [31].\nTherefore, this protocol should not be seen as a solution to a\nsocio-environmental crisis, but rather as an operational support for\nambitious policies aimed at reorganizing the conditions of subsis-\ntence in society during the Anthropocene. Ecological redirection\nprotocols should not be limited to isolated projects aiming only\nto altering specific practices and infrastructures. These protocols\nshould have transformative aims in a radical sense [15] for orga-\nnizations conducting them. They must initiate a real momentum\nof awareness, politicization, and action in response to the Anthro-\npocene. Ecological redirection seeks to trigger this transformation\nthrough survey and design, within an approach of heritage, arbi-\ntration, and closure, but also aims to initiate a broader dynamic\nof politicization of the techno-industrial model, to make it land\ntowards a desirable and sustainable society. Organizations shall be\naware of this transformative aim while conducting such protocols,\nin order to formulate radical change policies for their ecological\nredirection."
