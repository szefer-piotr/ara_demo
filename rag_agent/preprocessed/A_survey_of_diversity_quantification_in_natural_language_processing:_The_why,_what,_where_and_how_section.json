Diversity measures are\ncast upon a unified framework from ecology\nand economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3 dimen-\nsions of diversity: variety, balance and dis-\nparity.

Diversity\nmeasures can then be positioned along three dimen-\nsions: variety, which focuses on the number of cat-\negories, balance, which considers the evenness of\nthe distribution of elements in categories, and dis-\nparity, which targets the extent of the differences\nbetween categories (Stirling, 1994a,b, 2007; Rama-\nciotti Morales et al., 2021). For instance, a habitat\nwith 20 species has a higher variety, and therefore\na higher diversity, than one with 10 species (what-\never their numbers of specimens and differences\nbetween them).

It is\nassumed that diversity is important in many tasks,\nand that increasing it is desirable. Conversely, its\ndecline, e.g. due to training on synthetic data (Guo\net al., 2024), is a concern. The motivations of\nthis quest for diversity, when explicit, can be posi-\ntioned along two orthogonal dimensions: ethics vs.\npracticality, and means vs. goal (Table 1). Firstly,\nlanguage diversity can be seen as a goal in itself, to\nbe pursued for socially ethical reasons. Thus, NLP\nshould promote digital inclusiveness (Joshi et al.,\n2020). Datasets, systems, and benchmarks are ex-\npected to equally serve all users (Khanuja et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2024a), by representing different\nlanguages, language families and scripts (Kodner\net al., 2022; Goldman et al., 2023) and mitigating\nthe supremacy of English and English-centric bias\n(Pouran Ben Veyseh et al., 2022; Asai et al., 2022)."

Secondly, diversity\nis used as a means of achieving ethical goals re-\nlated to deontology and best practices in NLP. Thus,\nfine-tuning a pre-trained language model with di-\nverse prompts and responses limits the toxic and\noffensive content in LLM answers (Song et al.,\n2024). More diverse attention vectors in a trans-\nformer make it less sensitive to adversarial attacks,\nwhich try to fool it, e.g. to misclassify sentiment\nor toxicity of a text (Yang et al., 2024). A more\ndiverse benchmark makes evaluation more reliable\n(Chen et al., 2023b), notably because it shows the\nout-of-domain performance of a system (Pradhan\net al., 2022).

Extending class names with diverse\nsemantically close keywords increases the accu-\nracy of classification (Yano et al., 2024). One of\nthe reasons of this positive impact of diversity on\nperformances is a better coverage and representa-\ntiveness of domains, tasks, genres, hallucinations\ntypes (Xia et al., 2024), etc. Another practical ef-\nfect of diversity is informativeness: more diverse\ngenerated text is less generic and more informa-\ntive for users (Park et al., 2023). The quest for\ndiversity, notably in generation, is counterbalanced\nby the potential difficulty to pursue simultaneously\nmaintaining generative quality and consistence (Ma\net al., 2024).

For instance, answers to factual questions\ncall for precision and determinism (low diversity),\nwhile storytelling requires creativity and surprise\n(high diversity). Finally, a high diversity of gener-\nated text and its closeness to the diversity of human\nproduction, might not be an objective per se. For in-\nstance, the difference in diversity patterns between\nhuman-generated and AI-generated text may be an\nopportunity to effectively distinguish these two cat-\negories. This notably serves bot detection on social\nmedia, avoidance of fake news and protection of\ndemocracy (Kosmajac and Keselj, 2019). One final\nreason for the interest in diversity is to theorize it,\nand systematize its measurement, so as to under-\nstand better its nature and implications (Ploeger\net al., 2024), make educated choices of diversity\nmeasures (Tevet and Berant, 2021; Lion-Bouton\net al., 2022), and offer a reliable comparative frame-\nwork for NLP (Poelman et al., 2024).

In particular, hardly any papers\nrefer explicitly to variety, balance or disparity, as\npresented in Section 2. For these reasons, the statis-\ntics reported in this survey should not be taken at\nface value but rather as indications. Namely, it\nis us, not the papers\u2019 authors, who identified the\nelements and categories, and interpreted the mea-\nsures in terms of the theory of diversity. In many\ncases measures were unclear, even after conducting\nin-depth analysis or consulting the papers where\nthey were first defined. Nevertheless, the survey\nimproved our understanding of global tendencies\nin the field along the why, what, where and how\naxes. Our examination of the intersections between\nthese axes revealed two main prototypical, highly\ndistinct, scenarios. The first involves the area of\ncorpus creation. At the data collection pipeline\nstage, sources are selected with the ethical goal\nof ensuring inclusiveness and equality and/or as\na practical means of ensuring performance. The\ndiversity categories are meta-linguistic and mea-\nsures from the dQuantity family (variety) are used."

In\nthe first scenario, the fact that few languages are\nwell-resourced and many others are not is arguably\nnatural. Diversity-driven data selection is meant to\ncompensate for this fact, so naturalness and diver-\nsity are somehow opposed. In the second scenario,\nconversely, the diversity of human answers is often\nan upper bound for the systems\u2019 generations, so\nnaturalness and diversity are considered positively\ncorrelated. Different degrees of naturalness are also\nobservable in the categories and elements to which\ndiversity measures are applied. On the one hand,\nwe find \u201cnatural\u201d, i.e. (meta-)linguistically mean-\ningful categories such as words, idiomatic expres-\nsions, sentences, syntactic trees, genres, language\nfamilies, typological features, speakers, countries,\nethnicities, NLP tasks, etc. On the other hand, \u201carti-\nficial\u201d (i.e. non-linguistic) categories are observed,\nsuch as n-grams, BERT word pieces, word embed-\ndings, attention vectors, or points in a vector space."
