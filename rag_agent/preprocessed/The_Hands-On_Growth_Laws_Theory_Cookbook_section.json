These experi-\nments, performed under growth conditions limited by the\nquality of the carbon source, revealed a striking linear\nrelationship between the RNA-to-protein ratio and the\ngrowth rate (\u03bb), see Fig. 1(a).

By studying cells exposed\nto sub-lethal doses of translation-inhibiting antibiotics,\nthey corroborate [43] a second linear relationship: ribo-\nsome allocation increases as growth rate decreases un-\nder translation inhibition, Fig. 1(b). Finally, Scott and\ncoworkers investigated the physiological burden caused by\nover-expressing unnecessary proteins.

Global\nfactors such as the abundance of active RNA poly-\nmerases, ribosomes, and transcription factors, scale with\ngrowth and directly influence transcription and transla-\ntion rates [27, 44]. Consequently, gene expression cannot\nbe studied in isolation from cellular growth, as both pro-\ncesses are inherently coupled. For instance, synthetic\ngenetic circuits often behave unpredictably under vary-\ning growth conditions because changes in growth alter\nthe availability of cellular resources [24]. On the other\nhand, these circuits can also be designed to leverage\ngrowth-regulated dynamics, enabling more robust func-\ntionality and seamless integration with the host\u2019s phys-\niology [45]. Another interesting and non trivial behav-\nior highlighted by this theory regards the regulation of\nconstitutive genes [24]. Constitutive genes are, by defi-\nnition, not subject to any specific regulation, and there-\nfore, one would expect these genes to always result in\nthe same level of expression, regardless of the growing\nconditions. This turns out to be not true, as the regu-\nlation of other genes (regulated, like the ribosomal one)\nintroduces competition for the gene expression machinery,\nresulting in a shrinkage of the resource available to the\nconstitutive genes [5, 22, 27, 46], producing an effective\ndown-regulation of constitutive genes and proteins. It\nturns out there is a need of actively regulating the ex-\npression of genes, if the cell want to always keep their\nexpression constant."

Although the model presented here uses\nthree broad proteome sectors, future extensions could in-\nclude a richer set of sectors and more precise descriptions\nof the first growth law (see sections I-VI). For example,\nintegrating a stress sector might enhance predictions when\nresources are fluctuating over time. Integrating the degra-\ndation dynamics proposed in Sec. X could improve model\npredictions under slow growth conditions. Finally, the\nmodel can include perturbations from the second growth\nlaw and be adapted to measure competition for resources\nunder sublethal levels of antibiotics."

Even though we know potential mechanisms by\nwhich bacteria can externalise amino acids, we do not\nknow the kinetics of these processes and their relative con-\ntributions to amino acid leakage [267]. This is a significant\nlimitation of models that were built using this framework."
  },

    "heading": "Nevertheless, they allow us to explore the dynamics of",
    "content": "microbial communities engaged in cross-feeding. Starting\nfrom a single-species model, one can investigate how more\ncomplex bacterial communities that share amino acids\nemerge through a bottom-up approach. One can also\nconstruct a multi-resource system (a model with two or\nmore amino acids, which would further allow the explo-\nration of auxotrophic species that are entirely dependent\non extracellular amino acids secreted by other species\n(see [50] as an example). We believe this set of models\ncould yield valuable predictions on how obligatory cross-\nfeeding is maintained across various environments and\nunder which conditions bidirectional versus unidirectional\ncross-feeding is favoured. While this recipe focuses on\namino acid cross-feeding, similar models can be devel-\noped for catabolic cross-feeding in which extracellular\nmolecules are taken up, metabolically transformed intra-\ncellularly, and subsequently leaked. Finally, we discussed\nthe idea that proteome allocation in a given environment\ncan be shaped by ecological trade-offs, such as investing\nin preparedness for future conditions. This insight lays\nthe groundwork for building a general framework capa-\nble of predicting lag time distributions across different\nenvironmental fluctuations [51]."

I).\n(b) The variable s represents cell size, which can refer to mass or volume. Values shown are typical for E. coli and\nappear also in Tab. I.\n(c) X is a placeholder for the division protein copy number. The actual identity and typical abundance of the division\ntrigger is unclear and context-dependent. For example, for the division protein FtsZ the copy number is in the range\n5-10E3 [60].\n(d) These rates follow from the model\u2019s ansatz for X production; their values depend on the identity of X. For an\nexample of the values, please refer to Ref. [219].\n(e) Condition dependent, \u221eis the doubling time of non-growing cells.\n(f) On average, cells divide at approximately double the size at birth: sf \u22482s0.\n(g) The amplitude of the fluctuaction is usually such that the coefficient of variation (CV) for the size at birth is\naround 15%. The fluctuation at division is related to the one at birth via Eq. (74).\n(h) The adder size \u2206= sf \u2212s0 is typically close to the average birth size s0.\n56\nSection X.
