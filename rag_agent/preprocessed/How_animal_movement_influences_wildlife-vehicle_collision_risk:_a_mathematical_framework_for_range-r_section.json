    "content": "Collisions between wild animals and vehicles are a major source of human-wildlife conflict, threaten-\ning both biodiversity and human safety [1, 2]. Roadkill is the second leading cause of human-induced\n1\narXiv:2507.17058v1  [q-bio.PE]  22 Jul 2025\nmortality for many common and endangered vertebrate species, contributing substantially to biodi-\nversity loss [3]. Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) also result in tens of thousands of human fatalities\nand injuries worldwide each year [4\u20136]. In the United States, collisions result in over 59,000 injuries\nand 440 fatalities annually, as well as more than 10 billion USD in economic losses [4, 7], and the\nrisk of any driver being involved in a WVC is roughly 1.2%. In Germany, approximately 200,000\ndeer-vehicle collisions are reported annually, leading to 3,000 injured people, 50 fatalities, and caus-\ning an estimated 500 million EUR of private property damage [8]. Recently, collisions with wild\nanimals have also posed new challenges to the deployment of autonomous transportation systems\n[9]. These events not only represent a direct risk to human safety, but may also disrupt animal\nbehavior and further threaten critically endangered species [10\u201312].\nNevertheless, roads provide access to health care, education, and other services essential for\neconomic growth and social development [13, 14]. As a result, road networks have expanded signif-\nicantly in the past century and are expected to grow further in the coming decades, particularly in\nrural areas where WVCs may be more common [15, 16]. Therefore, mitigating WVCs is a pressing\nenvironmental, societal, and economic challenge, critical for ensuring safe and sustainable trans-\nportation systems while safeguarding natural habitats and biodiversity [17]. Addressing this issue\nrequires quantifying the direct impacts of roads, particularly WVCs and mortality rates, and pre-\ndicting how road mortality patterns threaten the long-term viability of animal populations [18, 19].\nFor these predictive studies to be truly effective, they must rely on an underlying theoretical frame-\nwork that links mortality data to key factors such as traffic patterns, animal movement behavior,\nlandscape features, and demographic parameters. While joint theoretical and empirical efforts have\ntransformed subfields like community and disease ecology into more quantitative and predictive\ndisciplines [20, 21], road ecology remains dominated by descriptive studies with only a few efforts\nfocusing on developing theory-driven insights [22\u201324].\nInitial attempts to study WVCs theoretically used computer simulations of animal trajectories in\nwhich simulated individuals would eventually die when crossing a road [22]. These individual-based\nmodels addressed WVCs mechanistically, incorporating animal behaviors and vehicle movement into\nmeasurements of WVC risk [24]. When properly parameterized, such models can predict species\u2019\nmortality risk and roadkill hotspots [25\u201327]. However, they rely on complex movement rules that\nrender them mathematically intractable and limit their potential to yield explicit, generalizable\nrelationships between movement parameters and WVC and mortality risk. For example, a recent\nindividual-based simulation model identified correlations between road features, short-term animal\nbehavioral responses to roads, and the expected number of WVCs over fixed time intervals [24].\nWhile these results inform about how complex animal behaviors influence WVC risk, they are\ntied to highly specific scenarios and lack the generalizability needed to develop robust WVC risk\n2\nestimators that can be informed by animal tracking data.\nTo overcome this problem, researchers have proposed using coarse-grained population-level mod-\nels in which partial differential equations describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of total population\ndensity in the presence of roads [23]. In this approach, roads represent localized sinks that absorb\nthe population density field at a rate that is a proxy for traffic intensity. This phenomenological\ndescription directly addresses WVCs at the population level and can provide expressions for relevant\nquantities, such as thresholds in road density that cause population extinctions and the correspond-\ning expected extinction times [23]. However, these models describe movement via simple random\nwalks, ignoring important ecological features such as range residency, which also complicates model\nvalidation using movement data [28]. This lack of a validation procedure is particularly risky when\ntransferring these population-level models to specific systems, as they can lead to erroneous conclu-\nsions that misguide conservation efforts and WVC mitigation strategies [29]. Applied ecologists thus\ncriticize this approach for lacking empirical validation and relying on highly unrealistic assumptions,\nsuch as animals moving infinitely fast and dying as soon as they encounter a road [29]. Despite these\nlimitations, researchers often estimate species vulnerability based on these predictions [28, 30, 31],\nas no better alternatives are currently available.\nAn improved approach to existing WVC modeling frameworks should balance a more realistic\ndescription of individual animal movement with mathematical tractability. Such an approach would\noffer a mechanistic understanding of how movement behavior influences key indicators of WVC risk\nand, by leveraging the vast amount of available animal tracking datasets, provide more quantitative\npredictions of species vulnerability to different road features. Here, we take a first step towards\ndeveloping such a framework, focusing on range-resident species, which occupy a restricted area\nthroughout their lifetime [32]. We study the interaction between a single animal and a linear road,\ntreating traffic as an adjustable external parameter. Large terrestrial vertebrates, which account for\nmost fatal WVCs and human injuries [4, 33\u201336], commonly exhibit this movement behavior [37],\nmaking it a particularly relevant first modeling choice."

    "content": "We introduce a general framework to quantify interactions between a moving organism and land-\nscape linear features, which we particularize for the case of range-resident terrestrial animals inter-\nacting with vehicles traveling on a road. Wildlife-vehicle collisions are multi-step events that occur\nwhen an animal and a vehicle coincide at a road location and fail to avoid each other. Mathe-\nmatically, this type of interaction can be described as a reaction-diffusion process [38, 39] in which\nreactions (collisions) occur probabilistically when a diffusion process (individual\u2019s trajectory) occu-\n3\npies a specific region of its phase space (the road) [40]. Our modeling framework thus consists of\nthree components:\nMovement modeling. We describe animal trajectories z(t) as independent realizations of a two-\ndimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process [41]. To keep the problem mathematically\ntractable, we assume that movement is isotropic and separable into two independent components,\nz(t) = (x(t), y(t)). We, moreover, set the origin of coordinates at the individual home-range center,\nsuch that OU trajectories are solutions of a two-dimensional stochastic differential equation of the\nform\n\u02d9z(t) = \u00b5(z) + \u03a3(z) \u03be(t),\n(2.1)\nwhere \u03be is a two-dimensional Gaussian white noise with zero mean and identity covariance matrix\nand\n\u00b5(z) = \u2212\u03c4 \u22121z;\n\u03a3(z) =\n\u221a\n2\u03c4 \u22121\u03c3I.\n(2.2)\nI is the identity matrix, \u03c4 sets the characteristic time scale of the movement by fixing the home-\nrange mean crossing time, and \u03c32 sets the home-range area by modulating the intensity of the\nstochastic movement component [42].\nRoad and traffic modeling. We consider that a linear road of width \u2206d crosses the landscape\nat a distance d from the home-range center. Without loss of generality and to keep mathematical\nsimplicity, we define the y axis parallel to the road (Fig. 1A). Mathematically, such a road is defined\nas the region of the landscape\n\u2126= [d \u2212\u2206d/2, d + \u2206d/2] \u00d7 R \u2282R2.\n(2.3)\nWe restrict our study to animals whose home ranges are such that the typical length scale of motion\nis much larger than the road width, \u03c3 \u226b\u2206d, which is true for most mid- to large-sized mammals\n[37]. For the traffic dynamics, we assume that the movement of vehicles is approximately mutually\nindependent and much faster than animal movement, which allows us not to resolve traffic in space.\nInstead, we model the traffic on the road as a sequence of discrete temporal events, each of which\nrepresents the appearance of a vehicle on the road. Because we assume that these discrete events\nare mutually independent, we can represent traffic volume in terms of a homogeneous Poisson point\nprocess of incoming vehicles at a rate \u03bd0.\nCollision modeling. In real-world scenarios, WVCs are multi-step complex processes resulting\nfrom traffic volume, and how animals and drivers respond to each other\u2019s presence [19, 43]. Given\na proportion q of accidents per incoming vehicle and a rate of incoming vehicles \u03bd0, potential\ncollisions occur at a rate \u03bd = q\u03bd0. This rate defines the time sequence of potential collisions as\na local Poisson point process on the road C\u2126= {ci} i \u2208N. Because C\u2126has homogeneous and\n4\nstationary increments, it defines a sequence of times of possible WVCs that are only realized if the\nanimal is at the road\u2014i.e., occupies \u2126\u2014at time ci (Fig. 1B). Considering this definition for C\u2126, the\ncollision time R is the stopping time for the movement process defined by the first coincidence of a\npotential collision event with the occupation of the region \u2126,"

On the other hand, K is the\ncollision time given the initial condition that the animal is at the road \u2126(Fig. 1B).\nTo obtain exact expressions for some of the statistical properties of the collision times, we\nreduce this two-dimensional modeling setup to a one-dimensional problem by exploiting some of\nthe assumptions we made regarding landscape geometry and movement behavior. In particular,\nwe model the road as a straight line aligned with one of the coordinate axes and consider animal\nmovement components along each of these axes independent. Additionally, we do not resolve car\nmovement within the road and consider that the road is either occupied by a car or empty following\na Poisson process. Under these assumptions, displacements in the y coordinate (parallel to the\nroad; Fig. 1) are irrelevant for the road crossing events and we can obtain statistics of the collision\ntimes by working with the probability density P(x, t) in the direction perpendicular to the road.\nSpecifically, we obtain exact expressions for the collision time distribution and use this result to\ncompute two metrics of WVC risk. First, the expected collision time, which defines a characteristic\ntime scale at which the animal will eventually die on the road. Second, the expected animal lifetime\nreduction due to mortality on the road, which is based on the extent to which death by collision\nincreases the animal\u2019s chances of dying above its background death rate.\n5\nx\nFigure 1: A) Schematic representation of the wildlife-vehicle interaction problem.

A linear road of width \u2206d, where cars appear following a Poisson point process\nwith rate \u03bd0, crosses the animal home range at distance d from its center. We are interested in computing\nthe collision times between these cars and animal trajectories starting from a random initial condition, r0,\nsampled from the animal utilization function. (B) This encounter process can be mapped to a time process\nin which traffic intensity is defined by a local Poisson process with rate \u03bd0 on the road, and the features of\nanimal trajectories in space define the time statistics of its road crossing events. Within this framework, the\nanimal may cross the road several times (blue lines in panels A and B) before colliding with a car (red line)."

Therefore, in this\nlimit, the collision times only depend on the properties of the traffic, the road, and the animal range\ndistribution evaluated at the road location. In this limit, WVCs are given by a stationary process\nin which collisions are uniformly distributed in time with a constant rate given by a combination\nof the traffic parameter and road occupation probability (Fig. 2).

For low values of d, larger home ranges lead to higher collision times, while larger values\nof d revert this trend (Fig. 3).\nTwo particularly relevant limits, representative of how different species use roads, are those in\nwhich the road is sufficiently far from the home-range center and hence rarely visited by the animal,\nand the limit in which home ranges are established close to roads [57]. We can approximate the\nbehavior of the generalized hypergeometric function in these two limits to obtain simpler expressions\nfor the mean collision time. If we consider the limit in which roads are sufficiently far from the\nanimal home-range center, d \u22652\u03c3, we can use the asymptote of the hypergeometric function [58]\nand approximate the mean first hitting time by,\n\u27e8T\u27e9\u223c\u03c4\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c32\nd\ne\nd2\n2\u03c32 .\n(3.12)\n\u27e8R\u27e9can thus be approximated by (3.12) and (3.11) (solid black lines in Fig. 3). Alternatively, when\nhome ranges are placed close to the road and d \u226a\u03c3, the mean first hitting time at lowest order in\nd/\u03c3 is\n\u27e8T\u27e9= \u03c4 log 2 + \u03c4 d2\n\u03c32 ,\n(3.13)\nwhich also provides a good approximation to the mean collision time in this limit (dashed black\nlines Fig. 3).\nFinally, we use the expressions for \u27e8T\u27e9and \u27e8K\u27e9, (3.10) and (3.11) respectively, to explore how\nthe diffusion and reaction-limited regimes discussed in Section 3.1 are defined by traffic intensity\nand other measurable parameters. First, to build a quantitative intuition on how these two regimes\nare settled within a realistic range of parameters, we consider a hypothetical animal with a range\ndistribution area \u03c32 = 100 km2 and average home-range crossing time \u03c4 = 2 day whose home-range\nis crossed by a road of width 10 m (so the \u2206d \u226a\u03c3 condition is met) at a distance d = 4 km\nfrom the home-range center.

    "content": "Wildlife-vehicle collisions are multi-step processes in which an animal and a vehicle must simulta-\nneously occupy a road location and fail to avoid each other. Mathematically, these processes can\nbe studied as a reaction-diffusion process, in which reactions (collisions) occur at a given rate, pro-\nvided that a diffusion process (individual\u2019s movement) occupies a specific region of its phase space\n(the road) [40]. Building on recent advances in theoretical studies of animal encounters through\nreaction-diffusion processes [39, 59\u201361] and leveraging well-established techniques from condensed\nmatter physics [46, 47, 62], we developed the first mathematically tractable framework to study\nanimal-vehicle collisions at the level of individual movement and, to further demonstrate how this\nnew framework captures key features of WVC dynamics, we compared our theoretical results with\nnumerical simulations of the collision process.\nWe focused on range-resident terrestrial animals, which account for the highest number of human\nfatalities and injuries caused by WVCs [4, 33, 36], and derived expressions for the expected collision\ntime and the probability that such a collision occurs before the animal dies due to other factors.\nIn our framework, this probability of premature death translates to a reduction in the individual\u2019s\naverage lifespan due to road mortality. The expected collision time depends in non-trivial ways on\neasily measurable parameters, such as traffic volume or road width, as well as movement parameters\nfor which robust statistical estimators exist, such as home-range size and home-range crossing rates\n[63]. We further derived relationships between the effective traffic intensity, \u03b7, and the probability of\n14\ndeath per crossing, a typical output of fine-scale simulation models and often estimated from roadkill\ncounts [25, 64]. The reduction in average lifespan requires knowledge of a species\u2019 or population\u2019s\nlifespan, which can be estimated from survivorship curves [65, 66]. Therefore, our results provide a\nfoundation from which statistical estimators that quantify road-induced animal mortality patterns\nbased on road features and animal movement behavior could be derived. However, such an effort\nwould entail substantial additional technical work, and is thus well beyond the scope of this paper.\nEstimating encounter times is generally a very challenging task, requiring the estimation of\nfirst-hitting times based on statistics of animal trajectories. Our results, however, identify a range\nof conditions under which the statistics of animal-vehicle collision times follow a Poisson process.\nIn this limit, information on animal trajectories is irrelevant and can be replaced by the animal\u2019s\nrange distribution (i.e., the stationary probability density function of animal locations). Specifically,\nwhen the characteristic animal velocity v \u223c\u03c3/\u03c4 is much larger than the rate at which vehicles enter\nthe road, \u03bd, times the road width \u2206d, collision times can be computed simply by evaluating the\nanimal\u2019s range distribution at the location of the road using Eq. (3.11). This property of the collision\ntime simplifies its statistical estimation by extending existing tools for estimating animal encounters\nthrough home-range overlap [67, 68].\nThe existence of this regime in which individual mortality on the road can be described in\nterms of a Poisson process also facilitates upscaling our framework to larger population sizes while\nretaining inter-individual variability in movement behavior [69]. Although this upscaling presents\nmathematical challenges, it is essential for developing spatially explicit population dynamics that\naccount for individual differences in space use and their interactions with roads and other human\ninfrastructures. This new class of models would provide a foundation for refining current estimators\nof species vulnerability to roads and for evaluating the broader ecological impacts of roadkill on\nbiodiversity[23, 28, 30, 31].\nFor this initial effort, we focused on the simplified case in which range-resident animals do not\nreact to the presence of the road. This assumption may hold for certain species, such as giant\nanteaters [70], and in cases where individuals have not yet learned how to respond to roads. For\nexample, young animals or populations newly exposed to roads."

    "content": "movement patterns near roads or vehicles in many other scenarios [24, 43, 71]. Introducing these\nbehavioral responses would generally complicate the calculation of collision times, making them\nmathematically intractable. However, in the limit where collisions can be treated as a stationary\nproblem, such behavioral responses would already be reflected in the observed individual range\ndistribution. This would allow for collision time calculations in cases where animals exhibit more\ncomplex movement behaviors.\nSimilarly, our framework describes incoming traffic as a time point process, neglecting the time\n15\nvehicles spend on the road, and treats roads as simple linear features. In the stationary regime, the\neffect of the animal movement behavior on the collision times is solely determined by the animal\nrange distribution evaluated at the road location. From an applied point of view, this result makes\nit possible to extend this model to more complex road networks, provided the integral of the animal\nrange distribution over the road network can still be performed. Relaxing the assumption of traffic\nas a time point process is more challenging, and its validity should be tested using simulations that\nresolve vehicle trajectories [24, 25].\nWith the ongoing and rapid expansion of road networks worldwide [15, 16], reducing WVCs has\nbecome an increasingly important issue for both biodiversity conservation and transportation safety\n[72, 73], driving substantial investments in a range of mitigation strategies [74, 75]. However, at a\nmore fundamental level, a theoretical framework untangling how the different processes underlying\nWVCs determine collision risk is lacking. Our framework represents a key starting point to develop\nsuch a framework, as well as a first step to bridge the gap between road and movement ecology,\nproviding deeper insights into the complex dynamics of WVC patterns. By identifying the key\nfactors driving these patterns, our approach strengthens efforts in wildlife conservation and promotes\nsustainable transportation practices."

    "content": "We can measure collision times and subsequently validate analytical calculations by numerically\nsimulating the stochastic reaction-diffusion process specified by our individual-based model. Tra-\njectories of the diffusion process may be generated by integrating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation\n(2.2) using a Milstein algorithm with discretized time steps \u2206t [76]. The challenge then becomes\nhow to count interactions, since in the point-like limit (3.3) the jump process lands on d with null\nprobability. Two routes are possible. One possibility is to explicitly simulate a finite-width domain\nwith the corresponding Poisson process of possible interaction events over it. We instead pursue\nanother, non-trivial solution, which is to assign a probability P\u00d7 of terminating the process at every\ntime-step where the interacting line is crossed. We highlight this possibility for ecological applica-\ntions, as effective probabilities per crossing might be an output of a fine-grained model of ballistic\nmotion at the road scale [26], or a measurable quantity in the field [25].\nEvaluating P\u00d7 as a function of \u03b7 is a delicate matter. This can be immediately seen from the\nfact that trajectories of the SDE are a.s. non-differentiable, meaning that the number of crossings\ndiverges to infinity in the continuum time limit. The point-sink limit in (3.3)) and the continuum\nlimit \u2206t \u21920+ do not commute. Nonetheless, analysis from the related case of partially reflecting\nboundaries shows that the finite-width region may be parametrized as a boundary-layer of width\nproportional to\n\u221a\n\u2206t. The full theory, developed in [48], shows that"
