In this paper, we employ recurrence quan-\ntification analysis to investigate the dynamics of the cyclic, non-hierarchical May-Leonard model,\nalso referred to as rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors systems, that describes competitive interactions among three\nspecies. A crucial control parameter in these systems is the species\u2019 mobility m, which governs\nthe spatial displacement of individuals and profoundly influences the resulting dynamics. By sys-\ntematically varying m and constructing suitable recurrence plots from numerical simulations, we\nexplore how recurrence quantifiers reflect distinct dynamical features associated with different eco-\nlogical states. We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that leverages statistical distributions\nof recurrence quantifiers, computed from numerous independent realisations, allowing us to iden-\ntify dynamical outliers as significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed\nnumerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent ecological regimes\nassociated with specific mobility values, providing also a robust manner to infer the mobility param-\neter from observed numerical data. Our results highlight the potential of recurrence-based methods\nas diagnostic tools for analysing spatial ecological systems and extracting ecologically relevant in-\nformation from their non-linear dynamical patterns.\nI."

By systematically vary-\ning the mobility parameter m and analysing the resulting\nrecurrence structures, we successfully characterised dis-\ntinct dynamical regimes of the system. To ensure robust-\nness and statistical reliability, we proposed an ensemble-\nbased approach, computing recurrence quantifiers from a\nlarge number of independent numerical simulations. This\nmethodology not only enabled us to examine typical dy-\nnamical patterns across the ensemble, but also to identify\noutlier simulations representing distinct ecological states\nwith clearly differentiated dynamics."

As\n12\nmobility increases, the system undergoes a clear tran-\nsition from irregular, turbulent-like dynamics to more\nstructured and coherent patterns, as reflected in the rise\nof determinism and laminarity. Complementary insights\nwere obtained through the recurrence-entropy measures,\nwhich indicated a progressive shift toward more pre-\ndictable and organised ecological regimes. Building on\nthis, we introduced a statistical procedure, termed mo-\nbility detection, designed to identify outlier dynamics\nwithin large ensembles of simulations. By analysing the\nstatistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, we were\nable to detect simulations that exhibited atypical dynam-\nical behaviour. Moreover, by establishing simple linear\nrelations between suitable recurrence quantifiers and the\nmobility parameter, we showed that it is possible to in-\nfer, with good accuracy, the underlying mobility values\nassociated with these outliers."
