Firstly, the engineering goal \nwas achieved \u2013 we created an integrated robotic system \ncapable of autonomous invasive insect monitoring and control, \nand demonstrated its effectiveness in the field. By comparing \npre- and post-deployment data, we saw clear evidence that the \nsystem\u2019s \nintervention \ncoincided \nwith \nsignificant SLF \npopulation collapse at the sites, which in turn correlated with \nimproved tree health metrics. This provides proof-of-concept \nthat a robotics-driven method can indeed contribute to \ninvasive \npest \nsuppression \nand \necological \nrecovery, \ncomplementing or surpassing traditional methods. Moreover, \nthe entire system was built at relatively low cost (~\\$1.3k), \nsuggesting a favorable cost-benefit if scaled, especially when \ncontrasted with the high expense of manual monitoring and \npesticide application (estimated \\$50\u201370k/year for human \nlabor in similar coverage). \n   Impact on Invasive Species Management: LanternNet \nshowcases how robotics and AI can be harnessed for \nenvironmental \nmanagement \ntasks \nthat \nare \nrepetitive, \nhazardous, or require 24/7 vigilance. Unlike manual methods \nthat often only target one aspect (e.g., scraping eggs but \nmissing adults, or spraying chemicals broadly), our system \nprovided a holistic, lifecycle-wide solution, targeting eggs, \nnymphs, \nand \nadults, \nwhile \ncontinuously \nmonitoring \nenvironmental feedback. The hub-and-spoke design proved \nadvantageous in covering a broad area efficiently: the central \nhub\u2019s powerful sensors and attractants drew in and detected \nmany SLFs, while the agile spokes dealt with specific actions \n(killing bugs, measuring tree vitals, mapping terrain). This \nseparation of concerns allowed each module to be optimized \nfor its task, yet all parts worked in concert. The use of \ncomputer vision (YOLOv8) was integral; it essentially gave \nthe system a pair of \u201ceyes\u201d to reliably identify the pest. The \nsuccess of YOLOv8 in this project aligns with other studies \nthat have applied AI vision to invasive species detection and \nfurther validates that modern object detectors can handle field \nconditions (varying backgrounds, lighting, insect orientations) \neffectively. By automating detection, LanternNet reduces \ndependence on human scouts and can potentially catch early \ninfestations that might be overlooked, enabling faster \nresponse."

On the software side, the YOLOv8 model \ncould be continuously retrained with new data (especially for \negg mass detection, which is challenging due to camouflaged \negg cases) to improve accuracy. The current model had some \ndifficulty in detecting egg masses at a distance \u2013 integrating a \nhigher resolution camera or a specialized egg detector \n(perhaps using a different spectrum like UV to spot egg \ncoating) could boost performance. \n      Broader Implications: The success of LanternNet opens \nthe door to expanding the Hub-and-Spoke strategy to other \ninvasive species and ecosystems. The modular design means \nwe can swap out the \u201cdetection logic\u201d and payload tools to \ntarget different pests. For example, the system could be \nadapted to combat Emerald Ash Borer or Asian Longhorned \nBeetle by changing the attractant (e.g., pheromone traps) and \nretraining the vision model for those insects. Similarly, the \nenvironmental monitoring could be tuned to relevant \nindicators (e.g. tree sap flow sensors for borer damage). We \nalso emphasize the importance of assessing ecological side \neffects: LanternNet mainly targets SLF, but we observed no \nsignificant harm to non-target insects during our test (the spray \nis directed and minimal). Still, as part of responsible design, \nwe plan to investigate the system\u2019s impact on non-target \nspecies and overall biodiversity in deployment areas. Ensuring \nthat our robotic intervention does not inadvertently disrupt \nother fauna or flora is crucial for ecological compatibility."
