      "Abstract \n",
      "Our study uses unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern Austria. We \n",
      "compare our drone-based estimates to camera trap data and identify apparent differences.    \n",
      "Accurate wildlife density estimates are crucial for informed wildlife management. Traditional \n",
      "methods for estimating density, such as capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps, \n",
      "are well-established but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal signatures (IR) \n",
      "and RGB imagery, unmanned aerial drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting from \n",
      "the air. Our surveys were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and \n",
      "November 2024 in three survey areas within a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape. The flight \n",
      "transects were determined based on predefined drone launch points, using a 350 m grid and an \n",
      "algorithm to define the flight direction of consecutive systematically randomized transects. This \n",
      "allows large areas to be surveyed in a single day, simultaneously with multiple drones, and \n",
      "minimizes double counts of animals. The flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing the \n",
      "target species, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), while ensuring animal detection. \n",
      "The number and species of animals per transect were manually annotated in the recorded \n",
      "imagery and extrapolated to densities per 1 km² for the entire survey region. We applied three \n",
      "extrapolation methods with increasing levels of complexity: naïve area-based extrapolation, \n",
      "bootstrapping, and modelling using a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. As a reference, \n",
      "we calculated a Random Encounter Model (REM) density estimate based on camera trap data \n",
      "from each area during the period of the drone flights. The three drone-based extrapolation \n",
      "methods yielded similar results, consistently showing higher density estimates than those \n",
      "derived from REM, except in one area in October. \n",
      "We hypothesize that while the drone-derived density reflects wildlife density in forested and non-\n",
      "forested areas during the daytime on single days, REM density represents an averaged value over \n",
      "a month-long period, capturing activity throughout the entire day within forested areas. Although \n",
      "both methods aim to estimate density, they offer fundamentally different perspectives on wildlife \n",
      "activity. \n",
      "Using drones for sample-based surveys presents a promising approach for density estimation.  \n",
      "Introduction \n",
      "Modern, data-driven wildlife management is based on reliable estimates of the distribution and \n",
      "density of a population in a defined study area. The use of imagery, for example, from camera \n",
      "traps (CT) or unmanned drones, is already well established for this purpose. Drones can \n",
      "autonomously collect data along pre-programmed transects and at altitudes that do not disturb \n",
      "wildlife, which can then be analysed manually or using AI. For example, drones are being used to \n",
      "monitor crocodile nests from the air (Evans et al. 2016), estimate jellyfish densities (Hamel et al. \n",
      "2021) or count ungulates (Ito et al. 2022). The accuracy and reliability of thermal drones for \n",
      "ungulate density estimations have already been tested in a study of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus \n",
      "virginianus) (Beaver et al. 2020). \n",
      "Flight transects are used to randomly sample sub-areas of the survey area. This allows large areas \n",
      "to be surveyed in a single day while conserving resources. In studies of ungulates, parallel \n",
      "transects were chosen to cover the entire area to avoid potential double-counting of moving \n",
      "animals (Beaver et al. 2020, Baldwin et al. 2023). However, the size of the study area and the \n",
      "shape of the terrain may limit feasibility. An alternative would be to select a number of shorter \n",
      "transects systematically randomly distributed across the area in a multidirectional manner. \n",
      "Depending on the individual detectability of the target species, CTs are used for capture-\n",
      "recapture methods (Seber 1974), distance sampling (Howe et al. 2017) or the random encounter \n",
      "model (REM) (Rowcliffe et al. 2008), which is particularly suitable for indistinguishable species \n",
      "such as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). A minimum of 40, and ideally 100, measurable \n",
      "encounters of the target species with the CTs should be recorded to achieve sufficient accuracy \n",
      "in REM density estimation (Palencia et al. 2024). To achieve this, CTs need to be active for a \n",
      "minimum period, which makes it difficult to sample agricultural areas, for example. One solution \n",
      "is to limit the survey area to forest areas. As roe deer use both forest and non-forest areas as \n",
      "habitat (Lorenzini et al. 2022), CTs placed in this way can only provide an average estimate of roe \n",
      "deer density in forest areas and not over the entire study area. \n",
      "In our study, we aim to test the feasibility of using drones along systematically randomized \n",
      "transects for density estimation and compare the results with those of CTs in forest areas. To \n",
      "exclude double counting and to obtain a systematically randomized transect selection that can \n",
      "be surveyed in one day, we used a simple algorithm based on possible drone starting points. Our \n",
      "hypothesis is that the two methods measure densities at different scales, as the CTs provide an \n",
      "averaged value over the duration of one month and over the entire 24h day in forest areas, while \n",
      "the drone method provides an insight into the density on one day, during the day and in forest and \n",
      "non-forest areas. \n",
      "Methods \n",
      "The three study areas are in south-eastern Austria in a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape and \n",
      "extend between 47.03281335 degrees north latitude and 46.80255756 degrees south latitude, as \n",
      "well as 15.98127187 degrees east longitude and 15.71521058 degrees west longitude. The areas \n",
      "range in size from 2.98 to 5.49 km² and in altitude from 267 to 476 metres above sea level. The \n",
      "submontane level is dominated by beech forests (Fagus sylvaticus), often mixed with fir (Abies \n",
      "alba), chestnut (Castanea sativa) and red pine (Pinus sylvestris). The region has a high level of \n",
      "ecological diversity, strongly influenced by soil and climatic conditions. The dominant ungulate \n",
      "species is roe deer, which is fed with roughage in winter in all three areas. The average annual \n",
      "rainfall is between 700 and 1250 mm (Kilian et al. 1994). \n",
      "All three areas were flown by DJI M3T and DJI M30T drones during daylight hours on one day in late \n",
      "October and one day in mid-November. A selection algorithm was used to select flights of up to \n",
      "7 connected transects, 350 m in length, based on possible starting points. At each turnpoint, the \n",
      "algorithm decided which direction the next transect should be flown according to a set of rules. \n",
      "This process was repeated until a maximum flight distance was reached. In this way, 28 to 47 \n",
      "transects per area and flight day were flown in several flights. The flight altitude was set at 60 m \n",
      "AGL to avoid disturbances and to maximise recording quality. The drones recorded RGB and \n",
      "thermal video sequences during the overflights, as well as the camera’s extrinsics, including the \n",
      "global position and orientation. Video footage was analysed separately by two observers, and \n",
      "sightings were geo-referenced and summarized per transect. \n",
      "Based on these data, three extrapolations of increasing complexity were made: i) a naive \n",
      "extrapolation from the total number of sightings in relation to the total area flown, ii) a \n",
      "bootstrapping procedure, and iii) modelling density using a zero-inflated negative binomial \n",
      "distribution. For the bootstrap extrapolation, a density was calculated as the number of \n",
      "individuals per km² from the summarized sightings and area flown per transect. Mean and 95% \n",
      "CI were derived from 1000 bootstrapping iterations. The short transect length of 350 m compared \n",
      "to other studies results in a significant proportion of transects without sightings (between 62.2 \n",
      "and 77.5%). We attempted to account for this by modelling the count data using the R package \n",

      "In our study, we were able to show that compared to a control roe deer density obtained using CT \n",
      "data and REM, drone densities were weakly significantly higher. Extrapolations at three levels of \n",
      "complexity resulted in similar density estimates without significant differences between them. \n",
      "This is a strong argument in favour of the simplest possible extrapolation using bootstrapping, \n",
      "which has been used in other studies (Beaver et al. 2020, Baldwin et al. 2023). In contrast to these \n",
      "studies, we calculated density per flight day and not as a mean of several flights. Considering the \n",
      "underlying distribution of the count data gave similar values to bootstrapping and naive \n",
      "extrapolation. Therefore, the naive method does not lead to biased values, but bootstrapping \n",
      "should be preferred to obtain 95% CIs. \n",
      "We see the selection of systematically random transects covering all four cardinal directions as \n",
      "an advantage, as this allows a homogeneous sample to be collected, especially in larger and \n",
      "mountainous areas. Especially in these areas, transects exclusively along or orthogonal to the \n",
      "contour lines would potentially result in a biased sample, as the target species may also prefer to \n",
      "move along the contour lines. In a study in a fenced area of white-tailed deer with a known \n",
      "population size, density was calculated using parallel flown transects and extrapolation with a \n",
      "bootstrapping method to determine the 95% CIs (Beaver 2020). However, with an average density \n",
      "of 69.8 deer/km², there were no transects without sightings. So, unlike here, count data were \n",
      "available without a zero-inflated part of the distribution. \n",
      "In our opinion, the difference between bootstrapped and modelled extrapolations and the CT \n",
      "density is a result of different sampling units. While CT density averaged over at least a month and \n",
      "over the full 24 h of the day exclusively in forest areas, the drone surveys provide an insight into \n",
      "the entire area exclusively during the day and on only one day. In Baldwin et al. (2023), ungulate \n",
      "densities calculated from parallel drone transects using bootstrapping were compared with \n",
      "mark-resight densities and N-mixture model (NMM) densities from CT data and yielded similar \n",
      "values (drone 31.3, NMM 27.5-40.7, mark-resight 27.7). In contrast to our study, the mean density \n",
      "of five flights was calculated rather than the density of two individual flights, as in our study. In \n",
      "addition, only one hour was flown around sunrise or sunset. An increase in the number of flight \n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Vegetation, often referred to as an “ecosystem engineer”, plays an irreplaceable role\n",
      "in maintaining ecological balance [12]. Through photosynthesis, vegetation provides\n",
      "energy and sustains ecosystems. Its ground cover mitigates wind erosion, stabilizes\n",
      "sand, and reduces soil erosion. Additionally, transpiration facilitates the transfer of\n",
      "soil moisture to the atmosphere, contributing to global hydrological balance [3,8,14].\n",
      "However, global climate change and the expansion of human activities have led to\n",
      "severe degradation of vegetation ecosystems, intensifying the process of desertification.\n",
      "This issue is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid areas, where water scarcity\n",
      "further exacerbates vegetation loss [4,28,35].\n",
      "Vegetation degradation during desertification does not occur uniformly; instead, it\n",
      "manifests in distinct spatial patterns such as stripes, spots, and labyrinths, each of\n",
      "which has profound ecological implications [20, 21, 29]. For instance, stripe-like vege-\n",
      "tation patterns are commonly observed in semi-arid landscapes [22]. To elucidate the\n",
      "mechanisms driving these spatial patterns, researchers have developed various water-\n",
      "vegetation models. In 1999, Klausmeier [13] introduced a seminal vegetation-water\n",
      "model to explain the formation of vegetation stripes on slopes and irregular mosaics\n",
      "on flat terrain, emphasizing the role of nonlinear dynamics in shaping plant commu-\n",

      "ing root competition for water resources, enhancing its ecological realism. Gilad et\n",
      "al. [9] formulated a mathematical model to analyze woody plant ecosystems in arid\n",
      "regions, capturing multiple feedback mechanisms between biomass and water availabil-\n",
      "ity. Recognizing that Klausmeier model did not account for water diffusion in the soil,\n",
      "Vander Stelt [32] incorporated this factor into Klausmeier model. Zelnik [42] simpli-\n",
      "fied Gilad’s model and utilized empirical data to investigate the Namibian fairy circle\n",
      "ecosystem, demonstrating that spatially expanding ecosystems undergo gradual pattern\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Spatial point process (SPP) models are a class of generative stochastic models that give rise to\n",
      "a random number of irregularly spaced events in a spatial domain. They have been used to analyze\n",
      "point patterns in various fields, such as ecology (e.g., Haase, 1995; Law, 2009; Warton and Shepherd,\n",
      "2010; Renner et al., 2015), seismology (e.g., Ogata, 1998), and social sciences (e.g., Mohler et al.,\n",
      "2011). One common approach to SPP modeling is to use spatially referenced covariates to fit an\n",
      "inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), a point process model in which point intensity varies across\n",
      "space (Gelfand et al., 2010). This approach is especially attractive in applications where point\n",
      "intensity is believed to depend on spatially varying environmental factors.\n",
      "The stochasticity in an SPP arises from two sources: the random number of point events and\n",
      "their locations, which we refer to as n and {si}n\n",
      "i=1, respectively. A standard IPP likelihood models\n",
      "both data types jointly, allowing spatial heterogeneity and total abundance (i.e., the total number\n",
      "of points in the study domain) to be modeled in a unified framework. This feature is especially\n",
      "useful when the data are partially observed (i.e., total abundance is unknown and may exceed n)\n",
      "and inference on total abundance is desired. We extend the IPP likelihood to data observed in\n",

      "2023, 2024; Leach et al., 2022; McCaslin et al., 2021). We showed that the complete likelihood for\n",
      "an IPP with spatial covariates can be similarly fit in stages where the coefficients are first estimated\n",
      "using the likelihood conditioned on n, then corrected with the Poisson likelihood for n.\n",
      "Fitting the IPP model in stages provides many benefits including increased flexibility in the\n",

      "The fast non-Bayesian estimation for logistic regression also allows for convenient pre-training\n",
